To who that review this code:
I try my best to dockerize files and project but I can't config db so if you want to run it 
maybe run it on local.
The best thing in this project is its design
things that can be done better:
1. testing and using mock objects
2. better main file structure
3. better git history and commits

I test it locally and it's functional but I hope it can be run on your machine.
Thank you for this opportunity and hope I can make it and pass this step but no matter what the 
outcome is I write a mini project for the first time in golang and also work with dockerfile and docker
compose and I'm super happy.

I think with a little guidance and better resources and an opportunity I can do far more
better than this.

Hope you will be great and happy and healthy.
